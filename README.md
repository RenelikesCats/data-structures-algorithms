# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my practice implementations of various data structures and algorithms. 
The primary goal of this project is to solidify my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts and improve my problem-solving skills.

## Learning Journey 

* **data_structures**:
    * âœ…**Arrays**:  implementation of dynamic resizing list. See `Array.h` and related cpp file `Array.cpp` files for details. The current implementation supports:
        * Dynamic resizing upon insertion when capacity is reached.
        * Inserting new elements.
        * Removing elements at a specific index with bounds checking.
        * Finding the index of a given value.
        * Retrieving the current length of the array.
        * Printing the elements of the array.
    ### Next on my list to implement
    * Linked Lists
    * Stacks
    * Queues
    * Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
* **Algorithms**:
    * Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort)
    * Searching Algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
    * Dynamic Programming examples
