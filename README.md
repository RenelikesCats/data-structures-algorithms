# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository contains my practice implementations of various data structures and algorithms. 
The primary goal of this project is to solidify my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts and improve my problem-solving skills.

## Learning Journey 
* ### Data structures:
    * Arrays ✅
    * Linked List ✅
    * Stacks
    * Queues
    * Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
* ### Algorithms:
    * Sorting Algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort)
    * Searching Algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
    * Dynamic Programming examples

## Done so far: 
* **Data structures**:
    * **Arrays**:  implementation of dynamic resizing list. See `include/Array.h` and related cpp file `src/Array.cpp` files for details. The implementation supports:
        * Dynamic resizing upon insertion when capacity is reached.
        * Inserting new elements.
        * Removing elements at a specific index with bounds checking.
        * Finding the index of a given value.
        * Retrieving the current length of the array.
        * Printing the elements of the array.

   * **Linked list**: See `include/LinkedList.h` and related cpp file `src/LinkedList.cpp` files for details. The implementation supports:
     * Adding to the Front: Inserts a new item at the beginning of the list.
     * Adding to the End: Appends a new item to the end of the list.
     * Finding an Item's Position: Returns the index (position) of the first occurrence of a given item in the list or returns -1 if the item is not found.
     * Showing the List: Prints all the items in the list to the console.
